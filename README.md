# 3D Apple Website

In this project, I created a 3D iPhone website, utilizing technologies like Three.js and GSAP to bring the design to life. This was my first time working with 3D models in a web environment, and I followed several comprehensive guides to master the tools.

I used Three.js to render the 3D iPhone model and GSAP for smooth animations, adding a dynamic and interactive experience to the site. The project also involved setting up ESLint and Prettier for code formatting, ensuring that my code was clean and consistent.

The resources I used were incredibly valuable, especially the GSAP Workshop Starter and Final projects, which provided a solid foundation and a clear path to follow. Additionally, I learned how to convert GLTF files into JSX, making it easier to integrate 3D models directly into my React components.

This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to explore advanced web technologies and apply them in a real-world scenario.
